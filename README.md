# Categorical_Model_Reference
Reference for multiple categorical algorithms utilizing Kaggle's Titanic dataset

The Jupyter Notebook in this repository processes data from Kaggle's Titanic dataset through various categorical models in scikit-learn to see the effects of each "side-by-side".  Descriptions, costs, benefits, and common-use cases are provided for the majority of all models used in the notebook.  

__Note:__ The point of this notebook is to better understand models.  Minimal feature engineering has been done.
